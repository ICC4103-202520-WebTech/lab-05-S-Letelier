As an Owner, I want Room management, so that it becomes easier and more accessible the management of the hotel. I also keep the log of the rooms and the information of the room if it is available or not and track the rooms who need cleaning service.

As an Owner, I want Guest registration so that I know who is staying in the hotel and which rooms will be occupied. This will make the management more efficient and help to prevent any possible mistakes during the registration.

As a Worker, I want Reservation creation and room assignment, so that the process of reservation is faster, efficient and easier for the customer to have a room. This prevents information mistakes, and with this we maintain a good log for the management of the hotel.

As an Owner, I want Service consumption tracking, so that we have a log of what type of service the customer prefers, and if the customer consumes a service, we can include them in the final price.

As a Owner, I want Check-in and check-out, so that we know when a customer confirms the arrival or departure of the room. With that we can update the information about the room status.

As a Owner, I want Invoice generation, so that all the money management is official and legal, and the customer receives a slip of what he consumes or purchased.
